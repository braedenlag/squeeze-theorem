There was a lot of calculus we did for this project that could not fit into the other recipies. So, we'll just put everything here.

### Birds and frogs

One day, a duck and a frog were drawn next to eachother on the whiteboard. Mr. Corbett added the integral symbol, creating a gastronomical delightâ€”of course, that is what happens when you put a duck inside a frog. This is a simple integral, but the special variables make it unique.

### Equation of a fly

A polar equation that looks like a fly is \\(r=(\sin \theta \cos \theta)^{3} + (\sin \theta \cos \theta)^{2}; \, 0 \leq \theta \leq 2\pi\\)

## That's a wrap

Thank you for listening to our project!
