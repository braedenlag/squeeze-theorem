An ellipse is represented by the parametric equation \\(x(t)=a\cos t, y(t)=b\sin t\\) where \\(a\\) is the farthest distance from the origin along the x-axis and b is the farthest distance from the origin along the y-axis.

How to find the area of the cookies? Our cookies are about 2.5 inches across the x-axis and 4 inches across the y-axis, so \\(a=\frac{5}{4}\\) and \\(b=2\\). Therefore, the equation we will be using for the ellipse is \\(x(t)=\frac{5}{4}\cos t, y(t)=2\sin t\\).  The formula to find the area is \\(A=\pi ab\\). But that would be too easy! We've struggled through enough problems on the whiteboards to know that calculus is really about virtueâ€”so we are going to integrate instead.

The area formula for parametric curves is \\(A = \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{2\pi} x(t)y^{\prime}(t) - y(t)x^{\prime}(t)\, dt\\). We can find that
> \\(x^{\prime}(t)=-\frac{5}{4} \sin t\\) <br>
> \\(y^{\prime}(t)=2\cos t\\)


Substituting these values into the formula yields
> \\(A = \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{2\pi} \frac{5}{2}\cos^{2}t+\frac{5}{2}\sin^{2}t\, dt\\)

Now we can factor out \\(\frac{5}{2}\\):
> \\(A = \frac{5}{4} \int_{0}^{2\pi} \cos^{2}t+\sin^{2}t\, dt\\)

Now using the Pythagorean Identity \\(\cos^{2}t+\sin^{2}t = 1\\), 
> \\(A = \frac{5}{4} \int_{0}^{2\pi} 1\, dt\\)

Finally, integration shows that
> \\(A = \frac{5}{4}t \, \bigg \|_{0}^{2\pi}\\) <br><br>
> \\(A = \frac{5}{4} (2\pi - 0)\\) <br><br>
> \\(A = \frac{5\pi}{2}\\) <br>

We can prove our answer using the ellipse formula, \\(A=\pi ab\\). We can see that
> \\(A = \pi \frac{5}{4}(2) = \frac{5\pi}{2} = A = \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{2\pi} \frac{5}{2}\cos^{2}t+\frac{5}{2}\sin^{2}t\, dt\\)

It may not be as useful as the optimal taco bite, or as cool as a calculus word search, but if you are making these kinds of cookies, you'll know exactly how much frosting to use.
